# Project 2 Analysis

### Introduction

As a job seeker, I have realised that there's a lack of data exploring the most optimal jobs and skills in the market. This project is to understand what skills employers required and increase the chances of landing a job.

### Questions to Analyze

To understand the data science job market, these are the following questions:

1. **What are the top skills required for a certain role?**
2. **What are the top skills of all data professionals?**
3. **Do more skills equal to more salary?**
